Hi! I'm a senior undergraduate at Department of Electronic Engineering of Tsinghua University. I study computer vison, deep learning and computer graphics(mainly geometry data processing). In summer 2019, I had a great time working on learning deformation space as a intern at [Guibas lab](https://geometry.stanford.edu), Stanford University, supervised by Professor [Leonidas Guibas](https://geometry.stanford.edu/member/guibas/index.html).

I plan to pursue a graduate program since fall 2020. If you have any interest please contact me!
