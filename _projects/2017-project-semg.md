excerpt: "We build a system that can evaluate the tremor severity of patients with Parkinson's Disease."
---

We propose a deep learning based approach for quantifying the tremor severity of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) based on surface electromyography (sEMG). We design the S-Net, a light-weight and computational efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns the similarity between sEMG signals in terms of the tremor severity. Labeled sEMG samples are used for jointly voting for the final results.

We carried on our work to further deployment in real devices after the experimental stage. We bought an sEMG detector as well as an Arduino Uno. Together with the Android App, we built a system that could detect sEMG and evaluate the severity of PD and integrated them into one portable device.
